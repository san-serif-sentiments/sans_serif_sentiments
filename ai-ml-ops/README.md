# Gen AI/ML Handbook

## Overview
This handbook is a **learning guide and reference** for understanding **Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Generative AI (GenAI)** in an **enterprise-relevant** way.  

It is written for **beginners and practitioners** who want to:  
- Learn the fundamentals of AI/ML frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow).  
- Understand transformers and Hugging Face models.  
- Build chatbots and GenAI applications with LangChain, CrewAI, and Flowise.  
- Apply these skills to **real enterprise use cases** in HR, Finance, and Supply Chain.  

---

## Why This Handbook?
- Most ML guides are **research-heavy** or **academic**.  
- Most GenAI resources are **demo-focused** and lack enterprise grounding.  
- This handbook bridges both:  
  - Simple explanations of terminology.  
  - Working code snippets (PyTorch, TensorFlow, Hugging Face, LangChain).  
  - Enterprise case studies and adoption insights.  

---

## Audience
- **Beginners in AI/ML** who want a guided path.  
- **Techno-functional professionals** (BAs, product, comms) who need to understand AI systems.  
- **Developers and data practitioners** looking for enterprise-oriented GenAI practices.  

No prior ML expertise required — only basic Python knowledge and curiosity.

- [Chapter 1: Orientation & Role Context](./chapter-1-orientation.md)  
- [Chapter 2: AI/ML Fundamentals with PyTorch & TensorFlow](./chapter-2-ml-fundamentals.md)  
- [Chapter 3: Transformers & Hugging Face](./chapter-3-transformers.md)  
- [Chapter 4: NLP & Chatbots](./chapter-4-nlp-chatbots.md)  
- Chapter 5: Generative AI & RAG (coming soon)  
- Chapter 6: Agentic AI & Orchestration  
- Chapter 7: Enterprise Integration & Cloud AI  
- Chapter 8: Optimization, Debugging & Evaluation  
- Chapter 9: Domain Use Cases (HR, Finance, Supply Chain)  
- Chapter 10: Governance, Security & Adoption  

---

## Practical Learning Approach
Each chapter includes:  
- **Terminology** explained in plain language.  
- **Code snippets** for quick wins.  
- **Enterprise examples** (HR, Finance, Supply Chain).  
- ✅/❌ **practical vs. non-practical scenarios**.  
- **Tips, friction points, success metrics** for real-world adoption.
