# Overview
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the branch of AI that deals with **understanding and generating human language**.  
Chatbots are the most common **application of NLP** in enterprises — from HR helpdesks to finance query assistants.  

This chapter introduces:
- Core NLP tasks (classification, entity recognition, summarization).  
- How traditional NLP differs from modern transformer-based NLP.  
- How chatbots are built using **Hugging Face** (models) and **LangChain** (orchestration).  

---

# Why It Matters
- **Enterprises run on text and conversations**: HR requests, invoices, tickets, customer chats.  
- **NLP + Chatbots reduce repetitive work**: handling FAQs, guiding users, freeing up humans.  
- **Job descriptions explicitly mention “NLP” and “chatbot design”** for GenAI roles.  

---

# Key Terms Explained
- **Tokenization**: Breaking text into smaller units (words or sub-words).  
  - Example: *“unhappiness”* → ["un", "##happy", "##ness"].  

- **Intent Classification**: Identifying the user’s goal.  
  - Example: *“I want to apply for leave”* → intent = “leave request.”  

- **Entity Recognition (NER)**: Finding key information in text.  
  - Example: *“Book a flight to Delhi on 12th March”* → entities = {“Delhi”: location, “12th March”: date}.  

- **Dialogue Management**: Deciding what the chatbot should say/do next.  
  - Example: if intent = “leave request,” ask for leave dates.  

- **Slot Filling**: Collecting required details step by step.  
  - Example: intent = “book flight” → slots = {origin, destination, date}.  

- **Traditional NLP**: Based on rules or statistical methods.  
- **Modern NLP (Transformers)**: Uses embeddings + deep learning for context-aware understanding.

# Quick Wins with Hugging Face Pipelines
```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Intent classification
classifier = pipeline("text-classification")
print(classifier("I want to apply for sick leave."))

# Named entity recognition
ner = pipeline("ner", grouped_entities=True)
print(ner("Please reimburse my travel expenses for Mumbai trip on 10th April."))

# Summarization
summarizer = pipeline("summarization")
print(summarizer("Artificial Intelligence is changing how enterprises handle HR and Finance by automating tasks."))
```

✅ Why it matters: These tasks (classification, NER, summarization) are the building blocks of chatbots.

## Building a Simple Chatbot (LangChain Example)
```python
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.chains import ConversationChain
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory

# LLM wrapper (using OpenAI as example, can be Ollama locally)
llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0)

# Add memory (so bot remembers context)
memory = ConversationBufferMemory()

chatbot = ConversationChain(
    llm=llm,
    memory=memory,
    verbose=True
)

print(chatbot.run("Hi, I want to know my leave balance."))
print(chatbot.run("Can I take 3 days off next week?"))
```

### Explanation:

ConversationBufferMemory keeps track of past exchanges.

This turns a raw LLM into a stateful chatbot.

## Enterprise Applications

HR → leave management bot, payroll FAQ.

Finance → invoice status assistant, policy queries.

Supply Chain → order tracking, vendor support.

IT/Helpdesk → ticket classification, troubleshooting FAQs.



---

## Insights

Traditional NLP chatbots (Rasa, Dialogflow) required heavy intent/entity design.

Modern LLM chatbots (LangChain, Hugging Face) are more flexible but need guardrails to avoid hallucinations.

Enterprises often combine both: rule-based flows for critical tasks + LLMs for flexible queries.



---

## Practical Example (✅/❌)

✅ Example: Use Hugging Face to classify HR queries and LangChain to answer with enterprise policy context.
❌ Non-example: Letting a raw GPT model answer finance queries without grounding it in real policy documents.


---

## Known Issues & Friction Points

Ambiguity: Users may phrase the same request in 20 ways → intent detection can fail.

Data privacy: Sensitive employee or financial info must not leak to public APIs.

Adoption challenge: Employees trust bots only if answers are consistent and useful.



---

## Tips & Best Practices

Start with FAQ bots → expand to task bots.

Use retrieval (RAG) → connect chatbot to internal docs for grounded answers.

Keep a fallback path → let users escalate to humans.

Track usage → measure adoption, not just accuracy.



---

## Success Metrics & Outcomes

By the end of this chapter you should:

Understand key NLP tasks (classification, NER, summarization).

Know how these tasks combine into chatbots.

Build a simple LangChain chatbot with memory.

Recognize enterprise challenges (adoption, compliance, trust).
