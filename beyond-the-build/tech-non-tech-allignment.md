# Dev–Non-Tech Alignment Playbook  
*Decode workflows. Distill assumptions. Deliver clarity.*

---

## Overview

This playbook exists to close the persistent — and often misunderstood — gap between software developers and non-technical collaborators (comms, marketing, BAs, PMs, CX, and beyond).  

It goes beyond rituals and Slack etiquette, addressing both structural misalignments and psychological frictions that hinder effective collaboration.

---

## Why This Gap Persists

| Surface Symptom | Root Cause |
|------------------|------------|
| Vague requests or unanswered pings | Context overload, lack of structured handoffs |
| Messaging misfires | No shared definitions or review cycles |
| Passive-aggressive retros or sprint surprises | Power imbalances in tone and ownership |
| Burnout or disengagement | Invisible rework, cognitive overload, lack of psychological safety |

---

## Framework: Decode → Distill → Deliver

### 🔍 Decode Their World

- Use shadowing, screen-recorded demos, or “watch a workflow” Wednesdays.
- Include walkthroughs of debugging sessions, feedback rewrites, stakeholder alignment.
- Observe both the technical and emotional effort.

🛠️ *Template:* `workflow-shadowing-template.md`

---

### 🧾 Distill the Vocabulary

- Maintain a shared **glossary-as-a-service** using GitHub, Notion, or Confluence.
- Assign tags like `@Dev`, `@Comms`, `@UX`, `@Security`.
- Encourage teams to submit “terms I didn’t understand this week.”

🛠️ *Live glossary sample:*  
```markdown
- "Release":  
   - Dev: Git tag merged into prod  
   - Marketing: Campaign go-live


---

🧑‍💼 Deliver with Translators

Rotate a Content Translator role each sprint.

Responsibilities:

Join sprint reviews and comms syncs

Translate PRs and JIRA tickets into plain-language summaries

Prepare update-ready formats: release notes, FAQ drafts, exec updates



💡 Don’t make this an extra job — make it a core visibility skill.


---

Advanced Mitigation Strategies

✅ Design Communication as Interfaces

Create communication contracts:

Inputs required

Format expected

Delivery deadline

Point of contact



🛠️ Sample contract:

[UPDATE TYPE]: Release Summary  
[OWNER]: Product  
[RECEIVERS]: Comms, CX  
[DELIVERY DATE]: EOW  
[FORMAT]: 3 bullets + risk notes


---

✅ Install Shadow Sprints for Comms

Create parallel sprints that:

Track upcoming features

Prepare change narratives

Trigger stakeholder outreach and draft copy reviews



📘 Use shared roadmap trackers or sprint-linked Confluence pages.


---

✅ Timebox Context-Switching

Set up “quiet blocks” (e.g., 10–12 AM, no Slack tags for devs).

Submit requests through async templates with this format:

[ASK]: What does “rollback” mean in this case?  
[CONTEXT]: Q3 feature doc  
[DUE]: Thursday EOD  
[FORMAT]: 1–2 lines, no jargon



---

✅ Narrate Decisions, Not Just Status

Add a “Why It Changed” field in JIRA or Notion.

Sprint retros should include “Narrative Threads,” not just burndown charts.


📘 Example: “We paused Feature X to unblock dependency Z — which impacts CX language for rollout.”


---

✅ Dual Review Ritual

Treat release comms like code:

Devs review for accuracy

Comms review for clarity



📘 Run a joint “Demo & Draft” session before go-live.


---

What No One Talks About (But Should)

🧠 The Emotional Cost of Being Misunderstood

When devs overexplain or comms over-clarify, it’s not ego — it’s defense against misinterpretation.

Avoid blame phrasing like: ❌ “Why didn’t you tell us?”
✅ “What context would have helped earlier?”



---

🧩 Track Communication-Related Rework

Create a Misfire Log to track:

Where content got rewritten

Where timing slipped due to misunderstanding

Tags like MISSING CONTEXT, ASSUMPTION, LATE INFO




---

🧠 Cognitive Load ≠ Communication Laziness

Devs may ignore pings because switching tasks breaks mental models.

Comms may be vague because they were left out of early design decisions.


📘 Build rituals, not assumptions.


---

🧪 SME Radar: Don’t Always “Ask the Dev”

Sometimes:

The dev didn’t write it

The PM scoped it

The UX team influenced rollout

Legal changed the wording


🛠️ SME Checklist:

Who built it?

Who changed it last?

Who owns the outcome?

Who speaks for the user?



---

🧵 Tone Mismatch is a Power Signal

Role	Common Writing Style	Impact

Dev	Imperative (Fix this)	Can seem harsh
Comms	Conditional (If ready, we could…)	Can seem vague


📘 Normalize respectful tone alignment:

Devs explain why, not just what

Comms state intent with confidence



---

Templates and Rituals

Tool	Description

📘 Glossary Template	Lightweight Notion/Markdown template for cross-functional terms
🪜 Handoff Card	Structured async format for briefs, updates, and escalations
🧾 3-Line Sprint Summary	Dev-side summary for business readers
🧠 Misfire Log	Track rework caused by miscommunication
🎯 SME Radar Map	Identify true source of answers across roles
🧠 AI Prompt Library	Predefined prompt templates for translating tickets to comms



---

AI Alignment Tips

AI can widen the gap if prompt strategies differ.

✅ Create shared prompt templates:

Translate this PR into:
- Executive Summary
- Risk Communication
- Customer-Facing Bullet

✅ Use AI to:

Convert sprint summaries to email updates

Draft comms briefs from changelogs

Suggest FAQ answers from feature tags



---

Bonus: Communication Debrief Retros

Use retros not just for product incidents, but communication breakdowns.

Question	Purpose

What wasn’t said early enough?	Reveal assumptions
Where did vocab differ?	Flag glossary gaps
Where did we duplicate work?	Find the avoidable friction
What patterns keep reappearing?	Build a mitigation habit



---

Final Thought

Clarity isn’t a nice-to-have.
In hybrid, agile, AI-enhanced teams, translation is not a soft skill — it’s strategic infrastructure.

This isn’t about getting along.
It’s about getting it right.
